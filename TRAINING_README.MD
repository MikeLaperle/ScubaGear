## Overview

Welcome to the SCuBA training ground for OPA Rego. This branch is designed to be used in tandum with the training videos. The training videos discuss basic syntax and capabilities of OPA Rego. This branch is intended to aid in becoming more familiar with Rego and how it is utilized for SCuBA. Each Product (i.e., Sharepoint, Power Platform, Teams, Exchange Online, Defender, and Azure Active Directory) has an overall level assigned to it from 1 (easy) to 3 (hard). Each section in a product will have an indication of difficulty relative to the other sections in the product and some may have recommendations to complete other things first before attempting. I highly recommend reading the comments present as they are not developer comments. They exist to help you understand how Rego capabilities can be utilized in certain situations as well as why one is used over the other. As this branch is intended as a learning aid, there will be techniques taught that are no longer used in SCuBA. I will notate in the comments in these cases; However, I recommend still learning because they are part of Rego.
